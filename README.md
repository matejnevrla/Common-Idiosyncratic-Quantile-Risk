# Common-Idiosyncratic-Quantile-Risk

This repository accompanies Baruník & Nevrla (2024). In particular, it contains data on:
1. *Common Idiosyncratic Quantile* (CIQ) factors in the files `ciq_factors_nonstd.xlsx` (estimated on non-standardized returns) and `ciq_factors_std.xlsx` (estimated on standardized returns).
2. Returns of the high minus low portfolios sorted by exposure to the standardized versions of the CIQ factors in the `ciq_portfolio_returns.xlsx` file. Returns are obtained from decile sorts and both equal and value-weighted returns are reported. In addition, the file contains the portfolio returns of the high minus low portfolios based on the combination betas.
