# Common-Idiosyncratic-Quantile-Risk

This repository accompanies Baruník & Nevrla (2024). Namely, it contains data on:
1. *Common Idiosyncratic Quantile* (CIQ) factors in the files `ciq_factors_nonstd.xlsx` (estimated on non-standardized returns) and `ciq_factors_std.xlsx` (estimated on standardized returns).
2. Returns of the high minus low portfolios sorted based on the exposures to the standardized versions of the CIQ factors in the file `ciq_portfolio_returns.xlsx`. Returns are obtained from decile sorts and reported are both equal and value weighted returns. Moreover, the file contains portfolio returns of high minul low portfolios based on combination betas.
